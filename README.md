# dockerized-blog-website

This is an example project for my medium article - dockerizing a simple nodejs app using volumes

The app has 3 routes

1. static `/` route where you can create new post
2. static `/post/{post_title}` to get the post you created
3. `/create` route to store your posts in `post` folder

Run

1. clone this repo
2. `cd dockerized-blog-website`
3. `npm i`
4. `npm start`
